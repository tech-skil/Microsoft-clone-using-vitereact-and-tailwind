This project is like making a modern copy of the Microsoft website using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The main goal is to make sure it looks good on any device - whether you're on your computer or your phone.

## About

This project is all about using the latest web development tricks - we're talking React for building cool stuff, Vite for making things fast, and Tailwind CSS for styling things up real nice.
